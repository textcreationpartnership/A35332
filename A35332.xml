            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THough occa≈øion has not hitherto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to write to you all this time, yet I hope this will not be unwelcome to ≈øuch a well-wi≈øher of their Maje≈øties and Countreys Intere≈øt as your ≈øelf. We ju≈øt now Arrived here ≈øafe from <hi>Dublin</hi> Bay, whither our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Captain <hi>John Jennings</hi> was ordered out la≈øt Week, taking Their Maje≈øties Ship the <hi>Dover,</hi> Captain <hi>Whitaker</hi> Commander a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long for our A≈ø≈øi≈øtance: we Arrived at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> Bay about 11 at Night on <hi>Friday</hi> la≈øt, and came to an Anchor, ≈øent our Boats to and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain over the Bay all that Night and to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after, and did take ≈øeveral little Ve≈ø≈øels with Pri≈øoners, and Prote≈øtants, by whom we were too late informed that four Ve≈ø≈øels went richly loaded for <hi>France</hi> ≈øome five or ≈øix hours before we Arrived; but our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is that the <hi>Ruby</hi> and <hi>James</hi> Galley being ≈øent before us to Crui≈øe over again≈øt <hi>Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Salte≈øs,</hi> can hardly be ≈øuppo≈øed to mi≈øs of them. Our taking of ≈øo many of their Barks and Ve≈ø≈øels did ≈øo vex the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> that they planted abundance of Great Guns upon one ≈øide of the Bay, and play'd very ≈ømartly upon us all <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning, which our Men were ≈øo unconcerned at, that while their Great Shot came very thick about us on all ≈øides, yet all we returned them for ≈øome time were ≈øome few Hollows of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion after every Volley of the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Guns. But at length our Commander orders to weigh Anchor, and coming ≈øome nearer to them, returned them ≈øo hot Broad-≈øides that though all the place was full of Men, and convenience to keep our Shot from doing them much hurt, yet of a truth it was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant to ≈øee with what pannick fear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion they run every one almo≈øt a different way, in all the World like a company of Mice pur≈øued by Rats, indu≈øtriou≈øly making tryal of every appearance of a hiding place. The Hor≈øes run as confu≈øedly and di≈øorderly as the Men, and being madded with noi≈øe and di≈øorder, trod down numbers of them, for though there were a great number of Hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (for they feared our coming a≈øhore) yet in a little time not a Man was to be ≈øeen on Hor≈øeback ≈øave the late King <hi>James</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to put courage in that Spiritle≈øs Crew; but all he could do was with great difficulty to get their Guns carried off, and was forced to quit his Hor≈øe; upon which our Commander ordered the Boats a≈øhore, and going him≈øelf in Per≈øon, took a little Ve≈ø≈øel in the eye of ≈øeveral Troops of <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons</hi> that had come fre≈øh from <hi>Dublin,</hi> with whom, as we under≈øtood after, the late King <hi>James</hi> returned; but ≈øo ≈øoon as our Commander ordered the two Boats
<pb facs="tcp:57823:2"/>Crews a≈øhore, it was plea≈øant to ≈øee how ≈øuch as were on Hor≈øeback did Scamper, and ≈øuch as were on Foot did climb upon the Rocks like ≈øo many Goats. In fine, it not being ≈øafe for ≈øo ≈ømall a Number as our Boats Crews to advance far, our Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was contented to bring ≈øome of their Hor≈øes on Board of our Ship by the little Ve≈ø≈øel he had taken in their eye, for a token of their Cowardize, and the Engli≈øh Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, among≈øt which was the late King <hi>James</hi>'s own Hor≈øe, which he had quit, it ≈øeems, to order and encourage the Dragoons that were on foot. We brought four of the Hor≈øes, and ≈øpecially that which was the late King <hi>James</hi>'s to <hi>High-lake,</hi> and ≈øet them on Shore. In all the Action, though they lo≈øt ≈øeveral, as we could vi≈øibly ≈øee, and Pri≈øoners after taken confirmed, yet we lo≈øt not one Man, though yet there wanted not work for your <hi>In≈øtruments,</hi> which an≈øwered my expectation pretty well. There lay a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateer within the Bar, which we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med does carry Weekly Pacquets to and from ≈øome place of <hi>England,</hi> which we could not come at, our Boats being of too ≈ømall Force to attack him, and our Ships of too great Burthen to go over the Bar; be≈øide, that we was not allowed ≈øo much time by our Orders as to Man and Fit one or two of the Barks we took to attack him, el≈øe our Commander had certainly brought him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. The Prote≈øtants and Pri≈øoners tell us, That all things are ≈øo ≈øcarce at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> are like to eat up the <hi>Iri≈øh,</hi> and they irritated to ≈øee the <hi>French</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and countenanced, ≈øeverals ≈øpecially of the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> are daily killed upon the Score. They expected we were to lye in the Bay to hinder them from any commerce by Sea with <hi>France</hi> or other parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which terrified, and as the Prote≈øtants a≈ø≈øure us, would weaken them exceedingly, and make them quit <hi>Dublin.</hi> 'Tis commonly judged by Papi≈øts as well as Prote≈øtants at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that King <hi>James</hi> has a mind to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to our King; Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ≈øo much ca≈øt down, ≈øometime ≈øince he heard of King <hi>William</hi>'s De≈øign of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ireland;</hi> and of his little concern how things go with his Army. Others judge that he makes his account to quit <hi>Ireland</hi> at la≈øt, becau≈øe he is ≈øo earne≈øt in ≈øending off for <hi>France</hi> all the Be≈øt things he can, and tho≈øe al≈øo that are near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt to him, in the≈øe four Ships I ≈øpoke of; they tell us of a va≈øt deal of Plate, Gold, and Silver Money, be≈øide other fine Things; ≈øo that hardly any Money but their new Coin is to be ≈øeen among them.
